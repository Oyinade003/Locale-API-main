Locale-API-Documentation

The Locale API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints that allow developers to access and interact with location-based data, including regions, states, and local government areas (LGAs) within a specific country or region.

With the Locale API, you can seamlessly integrate location-specific information into your applications, enabling features such as location-based services, geocoding, and address verification.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

*Regions API**: Retrieve a list of all available regions or fetch details of a specific region.
*States API**: Obtain a list of states within a particular region or retrieve information about a specific state.
*LGAs API**: Access a list of local government areas within a state or fetch details of a specific LGA.

## Getting Started Guide

To start using the Locale API, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Obtain an API Key**: You must have a valid API key to authenticate your requests to the Locale API endpoints. You can obtain an API key by signing up for a developer account on our [Developer Portal](https:/.com/developer-portal). After creating an account, you can generate and manage your API keys from the portal's dashboard.
2. **Understand Rate Limiting**: The Locale API has rate and usage limits in place to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse. Each API key has a limit on the number of requests that can be made within a specific time window. You can find details about the rate limits and how to monitor your usage in the.
3. **Use HTTPS**: The Locale API only accepts requests over HTTPS to ensure secure communication. Any requests sent over HTTP will be redirected to the corresponding HTTPS endpoint.

4. **JSON Responses**: The Locale API returns responses in JSON format. If an error occurs during the request, it will be included in the JSON response with an appropriate error code and message.
Authentication

The Locale API uses API keys for authentication. You can generate an API key once you register on the platform.

You must include an API key in each request to the Locale API with the `X-Api-Key` request header.

### Authentication Error Response

If an API key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response code.
